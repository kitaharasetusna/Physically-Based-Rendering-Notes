# Physically-Based-Rendering-Notes
A comprehensive notes including some codes and pictures to help understanding <br>

I plan to write a notes with some scratch I fond helpful for understanding the book Physically Based Rendering, fourth edition: From Theory to Implementation 4th Edition.
I'm learning graphcis and openGL and some fluid simulations„ÄÅGeometry so I can only upload some 'hand write notes' at first.<br>

But I plan to write all this pics into latex/markdown when I got time(after reading through the whole book, and I will add some reference here.
